1. drawing horizontal lines from each point and extending it to MAX_INT (max possible value)
2. checking whether the line interescting the polygon
3  if yes,then checking no of times the lines are intersecting
4. If no of intersections are 1 that shows either point is inside or on the edge else point lies outside
